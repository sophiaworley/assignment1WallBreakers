Multisets
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/
Use a multiset for this one. You can also solve it without using one. How? Try to solve it both ways. How do the two solutions compare?
https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/
https://leetcode.com/problems/subdomain-visit-count/
https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/
https://leetcode.com/problems/most-common-word/
https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-characters-by-frequency/
https://leetcode.com/problems/set-mismatch/
This one has a few “clever” solutions but feel free to use a simple multiset solution.
https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-atoms/
This one is more difficult than the average interview question but it is good exercise! You will need to build a simple parser in addition to using a multiset.
