Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.


class Solution(object):
    def findComplement(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        x = int(math.log(num, 2)) + 1
        return pow(2, x) - 1 - num
